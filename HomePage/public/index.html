	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Sean Kelley, I am currently a rank 3 Junior at
		Ohio State, but this is my first semester here after transfering from
		a community college after 2 years. My previous programming experience
		is from classes I took at my previous college. My favorite programming
		language is C#, which makes me excited to learn C#'s main competitor
		in this course, Java.</p>

		<li>C#</li>
